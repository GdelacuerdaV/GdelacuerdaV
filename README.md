Hi, i'm Guillermo. A materials engineering PhD student. I work on the development of Tritium permeation and corrosion barriers for the breeding blanket of nuclear fusion reactors. 
My work is mostly experimental, but I want to incorporate simulations to it. I am also very interested in data science applied to laboratory results. 
As of now, I mostly work with Python, and I also have some knowdlegde of C++. I'm also looking into learning R.
